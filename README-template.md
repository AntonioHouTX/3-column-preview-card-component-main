## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In the beginning as I was working on this project, I was still a bit forgetful regarding the margins and padding of this project and how to get the final website to look just "right".  As shown in the code snippet below, I continued to tweak the various properties in CSS of the parent container and the child containers until I was satisfied with what was created.


```css
.main {
    flex-direction: row;
    max-width: 75rem;
    height: 36rem;
    margin: 7rem;
    padding: 0rem 5rem;
  }
```


### Continued development

My continued development in CSS will focus on the box model and how the margins and padding interact with each other in a container element.

### Useful resources

- [The W3 Reference Guide (CSS)](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp) - As always, the "go-to" resource for all things CSS related.  This proved invaluable in developing this project.
